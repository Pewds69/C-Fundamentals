# C Fundamentals

This repository tracks my learning of C programming with a focus on
memory, pointers, and system-level thinking.

The work is organized into phases, each with small focused projects
built without tutorials or copy-paste.

## Phase 1 – Pointers & Structs
- Arrays of structs
- Pointer traversal
- Passing data to functions

## Phase 2 – Dynamic Memory
- malloc / realloc / free
- Ownership and lifetime
- Dynamic integer container
- Safe API design

Future phases will build toward engine-style systems and C++.
