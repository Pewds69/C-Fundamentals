# Phase 2 – Dynamic Integer Container (C)

This mini project implements a dynamic integer container in C using
malloc, realloc, and free.

## What this demonstrates
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Safe realloc usage
- Ownership and lifetime management
- Defensive API design
- Separation of interface and implementation

## Files
- IntegerContainer.h – public interface
- IntegerContainer.c – implementation
- main.c – test usage

Built as part of Phase 2 of C fundamentals learning.
