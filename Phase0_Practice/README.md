# Phase 0 – Practice and Exploration

This folder contains early exploratory work done while learning
pointer traversal, structs, and basic memory concepts in C/C++.

This work predates the structured Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects
and served as experimentation to build intuition.

The code here is intentionally unpolished and kept for learning history.
